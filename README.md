## and now we build!

The events Module - Node.js has an EventEmitter class which can be accessed by importing the events core module 
by using the require() statement.

User Input/Output - Input is data that is given to the computer, while output is any data or feedback that 
a computer provides. In Node, we can get input from a user using the stdin.on() method on the process 
object. We are able to use this because .on() is an instance of EventEmitter.

The Error Module - The asynchronous operations involving the Node.js APIs assume that the 
provided callback functions should have an error passed as the first parameter.

The Buffer Module - In Node.js, the Buffer module is used to handle binary data.
